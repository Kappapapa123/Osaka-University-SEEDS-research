# Osaka-University-SEEDS-research

In 2023, I had the opportunity to participate in the SEEDS programme at Osaka University, which
selects 15 aspiring scientists from various highschools. There, I conducted ML research under the
supervision of professors in the Inuiguchi laboratory, focusing on mathematical optimization and
ML. For my research, I compared the efficiency of two models under different conditions-the
support vector machine (SVM) and the neural network (NN) model-both of which I developed
with python. I found that for linearly separable datasets, the accuracy of both models was similar,
making the computationally faster SVM a more efficient choice. At the conclusion of my research,
I presented my findings at Osaka University, receiving positive feedback from my supervisor
professors
